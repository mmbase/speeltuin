     MMBase is based on the single idea of creating a object cloud that represents
     what you want to share with people. We create objects like images, newsitems, or
     urls and store them as objects in MMBase. We then create relations between them.
     This makes it possible for MMBase to generate basic (generic) editors, since
     they all have the same basic idea of how an object is represented, as well as
     the relations to other objects.
    </p><p>
     Generic editors are meant primarily for site administrators. For your users you
     are encouraged to set up the task-based (specific) editwizards. In the urls
     given below we have setup an admin account so you can edit/change the objects
     within the installed cloud.

        'New technology' editors with JSPX, CSS, Javascript, MMBase taglib 2:
        <mm:link absolute="true" page="/mmbase/edit/x/"><a href="${_}">${_}</a></mm:link>
        Still experimental, and don't not work in all browers.

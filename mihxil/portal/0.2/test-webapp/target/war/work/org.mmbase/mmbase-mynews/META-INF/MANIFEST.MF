Comment: MMBase. MMBase MyNews (mmbase-mynews).
Description: The MyNews application is one of the oldest MMBase exampl
 es that still exists. It shows you a very simple
     approach to a news site, where you can see a list of news article
 s and click on one to view detail information.
     In its simplicity it is a good example to see how the basic MMBas
 e taglib works.

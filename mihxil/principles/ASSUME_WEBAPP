Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Assume that you are in a servlet environment
Qualification:
Explanation:
      Your Java code is not just java code, it is java code running in a servlet environment, so it
      may be subject to certain resctrictions while running.
Argumentation:
      Code is not optimally portable if no consideration is given to this principle.
Consequence:
      Make no assumptions on the OS.
      Make no assumptions on location or writeability of resources. To open resources (like
      configuration) you should use the MMBase ResourceLoader. Do not use java.io.File. The webapp
      may be installed as a 'war' and it's contents not available as File at all.

      If a file-system is needed for some reason, the MMBase 'data directory' can be used, or use
      File.getTempFile().

      Do not write anything to stdout, use the MMBase logging system. This can be configured to go
      to stdout if desired.

Allowed Implementations:

Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Database independency
Qualification:
Explanation:
      All code is implemented in a database independent way.
Argumentation:
      MMBase is principally indepent of the chosen database. So no code in MMBase should depend on
      features of a specific database (unless of course the code _is_ the specific database layer).
    
      Therefore this is also a principle for applications built on MMBase, otherwise they are not
      portable to other MMBase installations.

Consequence:
      You should use the search-query frame-work to build queries, without falling back to 'legacy'
      constraints.

      You should not need JDBC-connections yourself, but if you do, use ((DatabaseStorageManager)
      MMBase.getStorageManager()).getConnection() - do not try to make your own connections nor
      create your own database configuration - but leave that to MMBase.
      You should also add an issue to the mmbase bugtracker to report the problem you try to circumvent.

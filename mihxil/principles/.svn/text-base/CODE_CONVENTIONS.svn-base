Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Code conventions
Qualification:
Explanation:
      All source code is subject to code conventions.
Argumentation:
      Code conventions make it easier and more comfortable to read and understand each others code.
Consequence:
      When writing java, JSP or XML sources, you must take the MMBase Code Conventions into account.

      Summary for java:
        Java code is indented by 4 spaces. Do not use tabs.
        Use SUN's code conventions. See link for MMBase specific conventions.

      XML:
        XML code is indented by 2 spaces. Do not use tabs.

      JSP:
        Preferably, JSP is like XML (e.g. JSPX). Java code in JSP should be limited to an absolute
        minimum. Use taglib (MMBase taglib, JSTL). Complicated functionality could be done in some
        MVC-framework, or be delegated to functions implemented on MMBase datatypes, fields, builders
        or function sets.
        A JSP should be short.  A few hunderd lines is much.
        Use includes, prefering dynamic includes (mm:include, jsp:include) over static includes
        (jsp:directive.include)

        Switch off the session <jsp:directive.page session="false" />, unless good reason for using the
        session exists.

        Make pages cacheable by a front-proxy, (e.g. by using mm:content), unless a good reason
        exists not to (then explicitely make it uncacheable, e.g. by using mm:content expires="0")

        Always use UTF-8 for the response.

        Preferred is (valid) XHTML Strict.

      Javascript:
        Like java.

      CSS:
        K&R, indent with 2 spaces.

Allowed Implementations:
       Code wich obeys the conventions.

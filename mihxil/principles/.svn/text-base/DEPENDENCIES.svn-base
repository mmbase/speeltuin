Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Dependencies
Qualification:
Explanation:
      Dependencies should be minimal, and preferably on already existings ones (no redundancy).
Argumentation:
      It is easier for people not to have to know about several mutually similar functionalities.
Consequence:
      MMBase 1.8 depends on:
        java 1.4
        servlet api
        backport-concurrency (dropped when migrating to java 1.5)
        it's own logging framework (mapping to commons-logging, log4j, java logging exist)
        xalan  (may be dropped when migrating to java 1.5)
        commons-fileupload

      Taglib also depends on:
        jstl.jar, standard.jar

      Other known (optional) dependencies:
        imagemagick
        JAI
        activation and mail

      You should not depend on libraries providing the same functionality.

      Other dependencies can be introduced with reluctance and with good reason (e.g. several jakarta
      commons libraries, commons-collections, commons-validator etc)

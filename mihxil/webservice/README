Using this to test some things related to web-services.


Try:

mvn package
(cd example-webapp ; mvn jetty:run)

And look on localhost:8080



Applications:

cxf:
   The point was to implement a CXF based mmbase service here.
   It is not much more than an hello world now.
   The problem is that everything should be annotation based. I was still looking for some way to generated the
   webservice programatically using meta information from MMBase.

mmbase:
    webservice completely based on mmbase technology
    They are defined in config/webservices.xml
    You only point to an MMBase function or component and link an action to it.


example-webapp:
   Installs the above, plus some examples (src/main/config/webservices.xml).
   Can be run in jetty (mvn jetty:run)
